        How would I go about making the button open in a new window, emulating "a href, target = _blank"?
        I currently have:
        "button class="button" onClick="window.location.href='http://www.example.com';"> 
             <span class="icon">Open</span>
        </button>"
        The button isn't in a form, I just want to make it open in a new window.
